# Python Learning Project ðŸ“˜

This repository documents my daily Python learning journey.  
It includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts covering Python fundamentals, data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), modules, and working with APIs.  

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in Python while maintaining a consistent daily progress log. This will not only track my growth but also serve as a portfolio of my coding practice.
